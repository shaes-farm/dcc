# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

pnpm only (`packageManager: pnpm@11.11.0`).

```bash
pnpm dev            # 127.0.0.1:7777 via bin/dcc.mjs
pnpm build          # production build
pnpm check-types    # tsc --noEmit — the primary gate for type-only work
pnpm test           # vitest run
pnpm lint
pnpm format         # writes; run before format:check
pnpm format:check   # CI fails on unformatted files
```

Single test file or case:

```bash
pnpm vitest run lib/domain            # one directory
pnpm vitest run lib/domain/domain.test.ts
pnpm vitest run -t "status vocabulary"
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint → format:check → check-types → test → build, each independently of the others' failures, so one run surfaces every problem. Run all five locally before pushing.

## The spec is the source of truth

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the product and technical specification, frozen at v0.4, and it is the north star for every decision here. Work is issue-driven and each issue names its section — `gh issue view 2` opens with `**Spec:** §3.1`. **Read the cited section before implementing.** Section numbers are the shared vocabulary in code comments, commit messages, and PR bodies.

When the spec and an implementation convenience disagree, the spec wins, or an ADR supersedes it first (see below). Concretely: §3.1 lists 23 canonical objects but §3.2 defines URI schemes for only 18, so `Issue`, `Release`, `Dependency`, `Provider`, and `HealthCheck` carry no `uri` rather than have local schemes invented for them. Widening the model to fit a provider is the failure mode this codebase is organized to prevent.

### Architecture decisions go in `docs/adr/`

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is frozen and **is not edited**. When a decision extends the spec, corrects it, or picks between options it left open, record it as an ADR instead: copy `docs/adr/adr-0000.md` to the next number, add a row to `docs/adr/index.md`, and cite the ADR number alongside the § number in code comments, commit messages, and PR bodies. `docs/adr/index.md` is the list of everything true of the architecture that the frozen spec does not say.

This is for decisions, not implementation choices — those belong in the code and its comments. ADR-0001 is the shape of the bar: §3.2 defines `trace://` URIs while §5.3's panel library named no panel to resolve them to, so the resolver had a scheme with nowhere to go.

## UI work starts from the designs

The spec describes the surfaces in prose and ASCII (§5, §7, §8); `docs/design/` renders them. Read it before building or changing a panel, a component, or anything the user sees.

- **`docs/design/`** — the design system of record. `readme.md` is the voice-and-visuals brief: dark-only near-black ladder, one cyan accent, status colors always paired with a glyph, IBM Plex Sans for chrome and JetBrains Mono for every identifier, sentence case, verb-first actions, no emoji. `tokens/` holds the CSS variables, `components/` ships each primitive as `.jsx` + `.d.ts` + a `.prompt.md` stating its rules, `ui_kits/dcc-app/index.html` is a click-through recreation, and `SKILL.md` is the entry point when it's loaded as a skill.
- **`docs/design/mockups/`** — hi-fi mockups of four surfaces (Checkout Service · Deploys, Logs · checkout · qa, Knowledge graph, Settings), bundled into a single `index.html`, plus the left rail in `DCCRail.dc.html`. Mockups now live nested under `docs/design/` rather than as a sibling directory, so they reference the design system directly one level up (`../tokens/*.css`, `../styles.css`, `../_ds_bundle.js`) instead of carrying their own copy. Serve over HTTP from `docs/design/` — `file://` breaks the rail's `fetch()` import, and serving from `mockups/` itself 404s the `../` refs; see `docs/design/mockups/README.md` for exact commands.

The mockups are assembled from design-system components (`<x-import component-from-global-scope="DCCDesignSystem_28b72e.Panel" …>`), so a mockup names the primitives a surface needs rather than drawing it freehand. Build the primitive from its `.prompt.md`, then compose it the way the mockup does.

They encode the invariants, too, so match the behavior and not only the pixels: every panel header carries its data age ("as of 12s ago", "live"), identifiers render as their URIs (`deploy://qa/checkout`, `pod://qa/checkout/checkout-6df4cbf8b`), and a Grafana 401 is an `ErrorCard` that names the env var to fix and says which panels go stale until it is.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` still outranks both. A mockup showing something the spec does not define is a decision — write the ADR, don't quietly implement it.

## Architecture

A local-only tool: one user, one machine, the developer's own credentials, bound to loopback. There is no multi-tenancy, no hosted deployment, and no server-side user model anywhere.

Data flows in one direction, and the layering is the whole point:

```text
lib/domain  →  lib/providers  →  lib/graph  →  app/api  →  app + components
```

- **`lib/domain`** — the §3 vocabulary. Every canonical object type plus the resource-URI codec. **Imports nothing else in the repo**, enforced by a `no-restricted-imports` block in `eslint.config.mjs`, not by discipline. See `lib/domain/README.md` for its internal conventions before adding a type.
- **`lib/providers`** — the plugin system (§2.2). Every integration category sits behind an interface; GitHub is merely the first `GitProvider`, not a feature. Two rules hold everywhere: **normalize upstream payloads into `lib/domain` types before they leave this layer**, and **declare capabilities** — the UI renders only what a provider declares, so no capability means no affordance.
- **`lib/graph`** — the Knowledge Graph (§3.3), in-memory adjacency over plain `Map`s. Every edge carries provenance (`declared | inferred | telemetry | knowledge`) so the UI can always answer "why do you think these two things are related?"
- **`app/api`** — thin route handlers. Validate, delegate, return. No upstream SDK calls, no normalization, no business logic. They exist on localhost for credential isolation, a single audit/allow-list choke point, and stable GET URLs that TanStack Query can poll.
- **`app` / `components`** — Zustand for client/UI state (`lib/stores/ui.ts`), TanStack Query for server state (`app/providers.tsx`). Server state never goes in Zustand.

Only `lib/domain` and the app shell are implemented so far; `lib/providers`, `lib/graph`, and `app/api` are README-only placeholders. Those READMEs state the intended contract — read the one for a directory before filling it in.

## Invariants that outlive any single issue

- **Everything is addressable.** Every rendered object carries its URI. Navigation history, favorites, layout presets, and graph edges store URIs and nothing else — never an ad-hoc object shape.
- **Reference the five scheme-less objects by `id`, not `Uri`.** `Issue`, `Release`, `Dependency`, `Provider`, and `HealthCheck` have no `uri` to point with, so a `Uri` field aimed at one is unrepresentable — it type-checks and can never hold a value. Watch for this in tests: `[]` satisfies any element type, so an empty fixture array hides exactly this mistake. Populate reference fields in fixtures.
- **One status vocabulary.** `healthy | degraded | failing | deploying | unknown` (§2.2), defined once in `lib/domain/common.ts`. Providers map onto it with the mapping documented in code (K8s `CrashLoopBackOff` → `failing`, Vercel `BUILDING` → `deploying`). Missing data is `unknown`; never guess `healthy`.
- **Timestamps are ISO-8601 strings**, never `Date` — these shapes cross the route-handler JSON boundary.
- **Closed unions ship as a `const` array plus a derived type** (`STATUSES` → `Status`), so the UI can iterate and tests can assert the set.
- **Zod belongs at boundaries**, not in the domain. Config (`dcc.config.json`) and route-handler input get schemas; the normalized output of providers does not.
- **Secrets are env-var _names_, never values.** Config carries `tokenEnv`; credentials resolve server-side and never reach the browser.
- **Config describes only what cannot be inferred** (§4.2). A service can be `{ "id": "checkout" }`; the resolver derives the rest by convention, and explicit config overrides inference field by field. Inference conflicts resolve to _no binding_ plus a warning, never a guess.
- **Read-heavy, write-careful.** Safe actions only, always confirmed, always audit-logged; `prod-like` tiers require typed-name confirmation. Nothing destructive or irreversible.

## Runtime posture (§10.1)

Every `package.json` server script routes through `bin/dcc.mjs` so the host guard cannot be bypassed out of habit: loopback-only binding unless `--unsafe-host` is passed explicitly, port 7777, Next telemetry disabled for the child process. Preserve that indirection — don't add scripts that call `next` directly.

## Vendored directories

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/design/` (which includes `mockups/`, nested inside it) are prettier-ignored; `docs/design/` is also eslint-ignored. Both are exports owned by the kit that generated them — reformatting makes the next re-export a needlessly large diff, and the bundled runtimes (`support.js`, `_ds_bundle.js`) are not app source. Never run a formatter over them.
